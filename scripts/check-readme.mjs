/**
 * @file Compile and RUN every fenced TypeScript/JavaScript snippet in README.md.
 *
 * The README is the migration instructions for three services, and its
 * snippets are the spelling those services are told to copy. A snippet that no
 * longer compiles — or that compiles and is then REFUSED at registration by
 * `secured()` — is a defect of the same size as a broken export, and it used
 * to be invisible: the fourth review found `README.md` telling fleet-service
 * to write a construct this package throws on at boot.
 *
 * So each snippet is extracted, given the free identifiers it names (`auth`,
 * `RegisterRoutes`, `swaggerUi`, …) from a shared prelude, typechecked with
 * the repository's own strictness, and then EXECUTED. Executing is the half
 * that matters here: `secured()` enforces at registration time, so running the
 * migration snippet is exactly the boot the consumer would do.
 *
 * Two deliberate transforms, and no others:
 *
 *  1. the package's own name is rewritten to a relative import of `src/`, so
 *     the snippets are checked against this working tree rather than against
 *     whatever is installed;
 *  2. a snippet's leading `import` statements are hoisted above the wrapper
 *     function the rest of its body goes into, which is what lets a snippet
 *     use top-level `await`.
 *
 * Run: `npm run check:readme`.
