/**
 * @file The free identifiers the README's snippets name.
 *
 * A README snippet is written for a reader, so it says `listTargets` and
 * `RegisterRoutes` and `swaggerUi` without defining them. To RUN one, those
 * have to be something — and what they are matters: `RegisterRoutes` really
 * registers routes onto the router it is handed, `swaggerUi.serve` really is
 * an array of middleware, and `auth` is a real `createExpressAuth` over a
 * center nothing is listening on. Stubs that were merely typed would let the
 * snippet compile and prove nothing about what `secured()` does with it.
 *
 * This file is copied into `.readme-check/prelude.ts` by
 * `scripts/check-readme.mjs`, which is why its imports are relative to that
 * directory.
