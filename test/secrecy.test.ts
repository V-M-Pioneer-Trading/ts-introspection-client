/**
 * @file S1. The per-request state is invisible, and holds no credential.
 *
 * An earlier revision memoized the center's answer on `res.locals` under a
 * module-private Symbol, **keyed on the raw `Authorization` header value**.
 * Symbol keys are absent from `Object.keys` and from `JSON.stringify`, which
 * is what that revision tested — but `util.inspect` prints them, and
 * `util.inspect` is what a `console.log(res.locals)`, a debugger pane and an
 * error reporter that serialises request context all use. A live bearer token
 * was therefore one ordinary log line away from a log aggregator.
 *
 * The state now lives in a module-private WeakMap keyed on the response, and
 * the memo holds a SHA-256 digest of the header rather than the header. The
 * tests below are about both halves: nothing of ours is reachable from `res`
 * at all, and the token appears nowhere in the process's view of the request.
