/**
 * @file The fourth review's findings about the brands themselves.
 *
 * Three separate claims, all about the same mechanism:
 *
 * **B1.** `notFound()` was an authorization bypass. `secured(express())
 * .use("/admin", notFound(mutatingHandler))` registered without complaint and
 * `POST /admin/delete-everything` answered `200` with zero calls to the
 * center: `assertUseSafe` ignored the path argument and a terminal vouched for
 * itself wherever it appeared, so `notFound()` was a way to spell "mount this
 * handler for every method under this prefix, undeclared". The brand was also
 * applied to the caller's own function *before* the registration was refused,
 * so a refused function stayed acceptable everywhere else.
 *
 * **S4.** `use()` lets an arity-4 error handler through unbranded, because
 * Express invokes one only with an error already in flight. The check is
 * `length >= 4`; relaxed to `>= 3` it would accept every ordinary middleware
 * and every `express.Router()`, which is itself a function of arity 3.
 *
 * **S5.** The brands are WeakMaps and WeakSets, never properties on the
 * function, so nothing a caller can write onto a handler vouches for it.
