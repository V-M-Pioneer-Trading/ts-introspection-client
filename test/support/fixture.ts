/**
 * @file Loads the vendored fixture, and refuses to let it drift.
 *
 * Three guards, all of which fail loudly rather than skip:
 *
 * - the file's sha256 must equal the one recorded in `SOURCE`, so an edit to
 *   the copy is a red test instead of silent divergence from meta;
 * - the sorted list of case names is asserted in the suite, so a case added
 *   upstream fails here until it is implemented;
 * - an unknown key in `expect` or `center` throws, so a copy that falls behind
 *   says so instead of quietly checking less (meta#79).
