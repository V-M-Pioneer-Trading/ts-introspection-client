/**
 * @file What counts as a credential, and what is done with it on the wire.
 *
 * The fixture pins the *answers* for a malformed `Authorization` header. This
 * file pins the two things it cannot see from outside: that a hostile token is
 * transmitted encoded and arrives byte-identical, and that the header parser
 * never invents a credential out of one that is malformed.
 *
 * Every case here is a mutation that would otherwise survive: joining the
 * remainder of a split header, accepting an empty token, picking one of two
 * `Authorization` headers, or writing the token into the body raw.
