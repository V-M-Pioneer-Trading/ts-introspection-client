/**
 * @file Public surface.
 *
 * Three entry points, deliberately separate:
 *
 * - {@link createAuthorizer} — the framework-agnostic policy, the thirty-five
 *   calling-service cases of `meta/fixtures/introspection.json`.
 * - {@link createExpressAuth} — the Express 4 adapter over it, whose
 *   declarations live at route registration so Express's own matcher binds
 *   them, and whose {@link secured} wrapper refuses **at startup** to register
 *   a route that carries none.
 * - {@link createLaneDeriver} — st-gateway's lane policy, which never rejects
 *   and is kept apart so nothing adopts it by accident.
