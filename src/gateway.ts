/**
 * @file st-gateway's lane policy. A separate export on purpose.
 *
 * The gateway does not authorize anything — that already happened, once, in
 * the calling service — so it never rejects, never answers 503 and never
 * throws. Anything other than an active `operator` is `background`, including
 * a center that does not answer: a gateway that failed closed on the center
 * would take the public read surface down with auth-service, which is exactly
 * what the calling-service policy is written to avoid.
 *
 * It is a separate entry point rather than an option on the authorizer so that
 * nothing copies it by accident.
