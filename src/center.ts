 * answer, because the caller's remedy is identical in all of them and the
 * distinction is the center's own business, in the center's own logs.
 *
 * Nothing here parses, decodes or inspects the token: it is an opaque string
 * that goes into a form body and nothing more (auth-design.md decision 21).
 * Nothing here logs, so neither the token nor the secret can reach a log line.
