 * `HEAD` is here because it is the *same route* as `GET` — Express dispatches

 * page already served anonymously. `OPTIONS` is here because a CORS preflight
 * carries no `Authorization` header by definition and a 500 there breaks every
 * cross-origin call before the real request is sent.
 *
 * This exempts them from **default-deny only**. A safe method on a route that

 * would turn a 401 into a 503 the first time the center was slow.
 *
 * The header must be **exactly two** whitespace-separated parts. RFC 6750

 * and is not repaired:
 *
 * - `"Bearer"` and `"Bearer "` carry no token, and are not an empty token to

 * - `"Bearer abc def"` is not the token `abcdef`. A header is never
 *   concatenated into a token — joining the remainder invents a credential
 *   nobody issued and sends it to the center.
 * - Two `Authorization` headers, which Express joins into
 *   `"Bearer a, Bearer b"`, are four parts and read as no credential. Picking
 *   one of them would let a caller choose which of two credentials a proxy
 *   sees a service verify.
 *
