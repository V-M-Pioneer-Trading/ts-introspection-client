/**
 * @file Express 4 adapter.
 *
 * Express is a **development dependency of this repository only**: nothing
 * here imports it at runtime *or at type level*. The interfaces below are the
 * minimum shape the adapter touches, declared locally, so the shipped `.d.ts`
 * mentions no package a consumer might not have — a consumer with
 * `skipLibCheck: false` and no `@types/express` typechecks against this file,
 * which is the claim CI proves with two separate tarball probes. Real Express
 * `Request`/`Response`/`RequestHandler` values are structurally assignable in
 * both directions, so nothing here needs a cast.
 *
 * ## The rule this file exists to enforce
 *
 * **A route with no declaration is never served, for any method.** Not for
 * `GET`, not for `HEAD`, not for `OPTIONS`. "Public" is a thing a route says
 * out loud — {@link ExpressAuth.allowPublic} — and never a thing that happens
 * because a lookup missed.
 *
 * Declarations live **at registration**, next to the handler, where Express's
 * own matcher binds them:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const api = secured(express.Router());
 * api.get("/ships", auth.requireSession(), listShips);
 * api.post("/ships/:id/navigate", auth.requireScope("fleet:control"), navigate);
 * api.get("/health", auth.allowPublic(), health);
 * app.use("/api/fleet/v1", api);
 * ```
 *
 * Whatever Express matched, it matched the declaration with it. Prefixes,
 * trailing slashes, case, parameters and `app.all` answering an `OPTIONS` are
 * all Express's business and stay Express's business.
 *
 * A table lookup cannot be made equivalent to Express's matcher, so this
 * adapter does not try — and that is also why {@link ExpressAuth.guard}'s
 * resolver is handed the **method and nothing else**. A previous revision
 * handed it `path`, `baseUrl` and `originalUrl`, which invited exactly the
 * table the design exists to delete: inside a router mounted at a prefix
 * `req.path` is the path *after* the prefix, it has not been through Express's
 * matcher, and a trailing slash, a case-variant path or a `:parameter` all miss
 * a literal key. There is now nothing to key on but the method.
 *
 * ## Position is part of the rule
 *
 * A declaration **must be the first handler of a route**. Express runs a
 * route's handlers in registration order, so a declaration that comes second
 * is a handler that already answered — `api.get("/x", handler, requireScope(…))`
 * serves `/x` to anyone, and a test that only checks "a declaration is present
 * somewhere" passes. The only things allowed before a declaration are
 * {@link passthrough} items, which have been vouched for as never answering.
 *
 * More than one declaration on a route is **refused**. Two declarations are
 * two center calls for one request and two answers to reconcile; there is no
 * reading of "and also" worth the ambiguity.
 *
 * {@link secured} enforces both **at registration time**, so the process does
 * not start. An undeclared route cannot exist, rather than being detected once
 * a request finds it.
 *
 * **The guard trusts `req.method`.** Any method-override middleware must be
 * mounted *before* it, or a `POST` arrives here as whatever the override said.
 * This package ignores `X-HTTP-Method-Override` itself and always will.
